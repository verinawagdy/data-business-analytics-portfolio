# EMPLOYEE_PERFORMANCE_AND_RETENTION
## 📌 Business Problem
Between August 2023 and July 2024, a tech company experienced an increase in employee
attrition rates. Despite regular performance evaluations and promotion considerations,
employee satisfaction scores have declined.

The objective of this dashboard is to analyze employee attrition, satisfaction,
work-life balance, and performance across departments and job roles in order to
identify high-risk areas and support data-driven HR decisions.

## 🔍 Key Insights
-	The department with the lowest satisfaction score is the one with the highest attrition (IT).
-	The average work-life balance is inversely related with the average satisfaction score.
-	The department with highest number of trainings is the one with the lowest attrition.
-	The total number of promotion is 945, 184 of them retired.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Since the training affects the number of attritions, therefore trainings must be mandated to departments with highest number of attrition (IT).
- Since the work-life balance affects the satisfaction scores which affects the attrition rate therefore more flexible work schedules should be allowed.
- More promotion should be offered to employees which lowers the total percentage of attrition.
